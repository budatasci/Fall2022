# How to Create a GitHub Portfolio for Your Data Science Projects

1. Create a new repository with the same name as your Github username. For example, if your username is "budatasci", you would name your repo "budatasci"

2. Follow the instructions on GitHub,  making sure that your repository is public and that you add a README.file

3. Once you create this repository, go to your homepage where you’ll see the following. GitHub initializes your profile README with a default “Hi there” message.

4. Now that you’ve created your profile repository, you can now edit your README. Go to the repository and clone it into your working directory.

    ```
    git clone <repo_url>
    ```

5. Go into this project’s directory and open it in your preferred text editor. 

    ```
    cd <repo_name>
    ```

6. Edit your README in your preferred text editor. List each project as its own separate section and have 2-5 bullet points describing what the project is about, the impact of the project, and tools that you used for it. Here is an example:

7. The rest of the format is up to you, just make sure that it’s organized and easy to read! Here is a [markdown cheat sheet](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-markdown-cheat-sheet-3d3976b31a0) to make it easy for you. This cheat sheet isn’t exhaustive but you can always look at other people’s GitHub portfolios for inspiration.
